# Binding Type
## Ionic binding
- General feature:
> - Common structure: NaCl, CsCl (metal atoms with nonmetalic atoms)
> - Binding force: Coulomb interaction.
- Properties:
> - the crystal structure is complex lattice，with a maximum coordination number of 8
> - high rigidity (高硬度) and melting temperature, **low electrical conductivity**, and small expansion coefficient

## Covalent binding 
- Common structure: diamond (nonmetallic atoms)
- **strongest binding** (stronger than ionic binding) 
- General features
> - the covalent bond is usually formed from two electrons, one from each atom participating in the bond. The spin of the two electrons in the bond are anti-parallel
> - saturation: restricted to electron pair
> -  **overlap of electron cloud** (AKA, hybridization): the more overlap, the stronger of the bond (related to the atom-atom distance); strong directional properties
- Properties:
> - high rigidity and melting temperature, low electrical conductivity; depends strongly on individual covalent crystal
#### Hybridization
> **Definition** : $\sigma$ hybridization
>  overlap of electron cloud face to face. (原子轨道沿键轴（两原子核间连线）方向以“头碰头”方式重叠所形成的共价键)
>  **Definition** : $\pi$ hybridization
>  overlap of electron cloud shoulder to shoulder. (原子轨道垂直于键轴以“肩并肩”方式重叠所形成的化学键)
> - e. G.

## Metallic binding
The binding between conduction electrons (**free to move about**) and ion cores
- General feature:
> -  communization of valence electron
> - bound by coulomb force
- Property
>  - The structures usually have [[晶系 Crystal Systems#Closest Packing|closest packing]]

## Van Der Waals Binding (范德瓦尔斯结合)
两个偶极矩之间的相互作用。(研究瞬时偶极矩)
- The **weakest binding** 
- General features:
> - The binding is very weak, no saturation or directional properties
> - The binding do not change the electronic structure of atoms or molecules
- Properties:
> - Usually have FCC structures: Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe etc. (with coordinate number 12)
> - Low melting temperature and rigidity, usually are transparent insulator

## Hydrogen Bonds (氢键)
being formed only between the most electronegativity atoms, particularly F, O, N.

- General features:
> - The H atom forms covalent bond with one atom and a weaker hydrogen bond with the third atom: Ｘ－Ｈ—Ｙ。

           
- Properties:
> - Low melting temperature and rigidity
